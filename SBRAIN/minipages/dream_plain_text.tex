    ``I am at a lake in my hometown.
    Something is going on there and we are in a hurry to get away.
    We get in a station wagon and have a hard time getting two pet deer, with the same names as my son and daughter,
    corralled.
    Finally we get them into the vehicle and we are almost all the way out when the wheel goes off one side of the road
    and the vehicle is stuck and the deer is about halfway out. At this point I notice my mother-in-law is cutting off
    a Christmas tree which is growing in the water at the end of the dock.''}
